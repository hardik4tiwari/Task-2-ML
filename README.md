# Task-2-ML

Could't complete the code due to errors and time constraint.

My Approach to this question was that I got a dataset from Kaggle which has Lung Capicity values for features such as age,gender,height,smoker/non-smoker ,etc.I labelled the categorical data and used Tidal volume =10% of lung capacity to get tidal volume and  i removed the duplicates to get a dataset of size around 250. Now, I could use any Synthethic data generator such as GANs ,VAE for generating a bigger dataset from this 
small dataset. The bigger dataset that i got then could be used for training a nueral network which could then easily predict my Tidal Volume.
